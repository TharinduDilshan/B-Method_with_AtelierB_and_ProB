# B-Method

<li> B method is a formal software development method that supports all stages of the software life-cycle in a uniform and formal way. </li>
<li> The main components are B models and proofs. </li>
<li> A B-model is a collection of components called machines. </li>
<li> B models are written in its formal specification language called Abstract Machine Notation (AMN). </li>
<li> An abstract machine has a name, local state and an interface. </li>

# AtelierB and ProB

<li> AMN is a wide spectrum pseudo-programming language that covers both abstract specifications and implementation level code. </li>
<li> B method is supported by CASE tools: AtelierB and ProB.</li>
AtelierB - syntax, type checking, theorem prover <br>
ProB - animator

# Chapter-1 : Setting up and Using AtelierB and ProB
Steps for Setting up and Using AtelierB:
<ol>
  <li> Create a workspace for all the B specification projects.</li>
  <i>Atelier B > New > Workspace</i>
  <li> Set the default project directory.</li>
  <i>Atelier B > Preferences > Project</i>
  <li> Create a project.</li>
  <i>Atelier B > New > Project</i>
  <li> Add components to the B specification.</li>
  <i>Atelier B > New > Component</i>
  <li> Start typing by double clicking the orange box.</li>
</ol>

Steps for Setting up and Using ProB:
<ol>
  <li> Once the machine has been syntax & type checked and there are no errors, animate it using the ProB animator.
  <li> Open the machine file created in AtelierB.</li>
  <i>File > Open</i>
  <li> To begin animation, double click on INITIALISATION.</li>
</ol>
