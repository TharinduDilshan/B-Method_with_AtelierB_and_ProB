# B-Method

<li> B method is a formal software development method that supports all stages of the software life-cycle in a uniform and formal way. </li>
<li> The main components are B models and proofs. </li>
<li> A B-model is a collection of components called machines. </li>
<li> B models are written in its formal specification language called Abstract Machine Notation (AMN). </li>
<li> An abstract machine has a name, local state and an interface. </li>

# AtelierB and ProB

<li> AMN is a wide spectrum pseudo-programming language that covers both abstract specifications and implementation level code. </li>
<li> B method is supported by CASE tools: AtelierB and ProB.</li>
AtelierB - syntax, type checking, theorem prover <br>
ProB - animator
